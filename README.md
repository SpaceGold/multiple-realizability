## Multiple Realizability: From Brains to Genes
*Leveraging directed graphs and algebraic topology on neuroscience and genomics! Inspired by philosopher Hilary Putnam.*

#### Introduction
At Berkeley in 2011, I studied Putnam and multiple realizability. In order to try to understand it, I drew this asymmetrical diagram:

![diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpaceGold/multiple-realizability/main/multiple-realizability-diagram.png)

Each *b* and *p* are distinct. For *b*, imagine distinct neural assemblies, or even different peopleâ€™s brains. For *p*, imagine different ideas, memes, or, more technically, propositions. These are semiotic units, like meanings or informational bits.

My understanding indicates an empirical asymmetry:
* Physical brain states can entail a common idea
* That idea can entail distinct brain states

But:
* Distinct ideas cannot entail a common brain state
* Nor can a single brain state entail distinct ideas

In conclusion, brain states (*b*) are:
* More numerous
* Redundant
* Overlapping
* Constantly changing
* Never identical

In contrast, ideas (*p*):
* Have multiple realizability
* Can be identical
* Can be persistent

For example idea that *cats aren't dogs* can be identical between people, but the brain states that hold that thought cannot be identical between people. Plus, even if they keep thinking this thought, one person's brain states from one moment to the next won't be identical.

This may have implications for genomics as a directed graph network where genes are instantiated asymmetrically within distinct cellular or epigenetic environments.

#### Analogies

*"Brain states are to ideas as epigenetics are to genes."*

Nature : Nurture  
::  
Genes : Epigenetics  
::  
Ideas : Brains



Am I wrong?
